# BIUMmisc

A collection of R functions and scripts commonly used by the BIUM-MZ Core Facility

You can browse the package contents at [https://imbeimainz.github.io/BIUMmisc/](https://imbeimainz.github.io/BIUMmisc/).

### Code guidelines
- You should place your function(s) in an R script named in a way that makes it easy to guess what's inside.
- Use [Roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) to document your function(s). Some useful tags: `@title`, `@description`, `@details`, `@param`, `@return`, `@author`, `@examples`, `@export`, `@import`/`@importFrom`.
  - If possible, add an example in the Roxygen preamble to show how to run each function.
